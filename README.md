# Description
I created this program with the idea of making learning and practicing Python more fun by adding a Snoopy theme to it. Instead of just writing a plain text-based code, I wanted to make it playful and interactive so that it feels less like work and more like a game. At the start of the program, Snoopy appears in ASCII art, which already gives a friendly and fun atmosphere. After that, the user is asked to enter a sentence, and from there, different options are given that Snoopy can perform as “tricks.” The menu includes several useful text operations such as reversing a sentence, counting vowels, checking if it is a palindrome, finding and replacing words, changing the format to title case, splitting the sentence into words, counting word frequency, and swapping the cases of letters. Normally, these are just string manipulation functions in Python, but I decided to present them as Snoopy’s fun activities. For example, reversing a sentence becomes Snoopy doing a backflip, and counting vowels is Snoopy sniffing around to find them. This makes the output more engaging and entertaining instead of just showing plain results. I also made sure that the program loops continuously so the user can try different tricks without restarting the code. It only ends when the user chooses to exit, where Snoopy says goodbye with another piece of ASCII art and a message about taking a nap. I added this part because I wanted the program to feel complete, almost like Snoopy is really interacting with the user from start to finish.

# Learning Experience
While working on this assignment, I learned how to use Python string functions like reverse, count, replace, and split. I also practiced using loops and conditionals to make the program run smoothly. At first, it was a bit challenging, but I enjoyed it, especially when I added the Snoopy theme. It made the activity more fun and helped me see that coding can be both educational and creative.
